              <h3>Receiving large files? Use Firefox, Chrome or Edge!</h3>
              <p>
                With Firefox, Chrome and Edge we can store the files directly to
                your disk. With other browsers the files may first simply be put
                in your computers memory. This is fine for smaller files, but
                with large files (1GB and up) this may result in unexpected
                behaviour.

              </h3>
              <p>
                On desktop devices (Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.) you can simply
                minimize this browser tab, but doing the same thing on a mobile
                device can result in Android or iOS putting the website to
                sleep.

              <h3>Make sure the sender keeps connected</h3>
              <p>
                The biggest mistake when using ToffeeShare is if the sender
                decides to close the website or turns off the device. Peer to
                peer only works if both sender and receiver are online at the
                same time.

              <p>
                We currently do not support sending folders. Instead you can put
                all of your files in an{" "}

                we simply fail. If you experience much lower transfer speed than
                you would expect it might help to simply restart the transfer.
